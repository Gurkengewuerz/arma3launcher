<h1>Haftungsausschluss</h1>
Gemäß <i>§1 Absatz 2 Satz 3 ProdHaftG</i> haftet das Entwickler-Team nicht für Schäden,
die aus der Nutzung des Clients entstehen, da dieser unentgeltlich angeboten und ehrenamtlich entwickelt wird. Das
Entwickler-Team übernimmt darüber hinaus keine Garantie für die ordnungsgemäße Funktion des Clients.<br/><br/>
Darausfolgt auch, dass es keinen Anspruch darauf gibt, dass der Client auf jedem System funktioniert oder Programmfehler
durch
Updates behoben werden. Wir bemühen uns zwar, ein fehlerfreies Programm anzubieten, bitten aber um Verständnis, dass
nicht jeder Fehler unsererseits behoben werden kann.
